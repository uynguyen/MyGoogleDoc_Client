/**
 * A default implementation of Caret.  The caret is rendered as
 * a vertical line in the color specified by the CaretColor property
 * of the associated JTextComponent.  It can blink at the rate specified
 * by the BlinkRate property.
 * <p>
 * This implementation expects two sources of asynchronous notification.
 * The timer thread fires asynchronously, and causes the caret to simply
 * repaint the most recent bounding box.  The caret also tracks change
 * as the document is modified.  Typically this will happen on the
 * event dispatch thread as a result of some mouse or keyboard event.
 * The caret behavior on both synchronous and asynchronous documents updates
 * is controlled by <code>UpdatePolicy</code> property. The repaint of the
 * new caret location will occur on the event thread in any case, as calls to
 * <code>modelToView</code> are only safe on the event thread.
 * <p>
 * The caret acts as a mouse and focus listener on the text component
 * it has been installed in, and defines the caret semantics based upon
 * those events.  The listener methods can be reimplemented to change the
 * semantics.
 * By default, the first mouse button will be used to set focus and caret
 * position.  Dragging the mouse pointer with the first mouse button will
 * sweep out a selection that is contiguous in the model.  If the associated
 * text component is editable, the caret will become visible when focus
 * is gained, and invisible when focus is lost.
 * <p>
 * The Highlighter bound to the associated text component is used to
 * render the selection by default.
 * Selection appearance can be customized by supplying a
 * painter to use for the highlights.  By default a painter is used that
 * will render a solid color as specified in the associated text component
 * in the <code>SelectionColor</code> property.  This can easily be changed
 * by reimplementing the
 * {@link #getSelectionPainter getSelectionPainter}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * A customized caret appearance can be achieved by reimplementing
 * the paint method.  If the paint method is changed, the damage method
 * should also be reimplemented to cause a repaint for the area needed
 * to render the caret.  The caret extends the Rectangle class which
 * is used to hold the bounding box for where the caret was last rendered.
 * This enables the caret to repaint in a thread-safe manner when the
 * caret moves without making a call to modelToView which is unstable
 * between model updates and view repair (i.e. the order of delivery
 * to DocumentListeners is not guaranteed).
 * <p>
 * The magic caret position is set to null when the caret position changes.
 * A timer is used to determine the new location (after the caret change).
 * When the timer fires, if the magic caret position is still null it is
 * reset to the current caret position. Any actions that change
 * the caret position and want the magic caret position to remain the
 * same, must remember the magic caret position, change the cursor, and
 * then set the magic caret position to its original value. This has the
 * benefit that only actions that want the magic caret position to persist
 * (such as open/down) need to know about it.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong>
 * Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 * appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 * the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 * of all JavaBeans&trade;
 * has been added to the <code>java.beans</code> package.
 * Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}.
